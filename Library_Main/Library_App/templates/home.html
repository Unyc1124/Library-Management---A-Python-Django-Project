                Why reading is important?
            </h2>
            <p>Reading is important because it broadens knowledge, improves vocabulary and language skills, and enhances critical thinking. It stimulates mental processes, reduces stress, and fosters empathy by exposing readers to diverse perspectives and experiences. Reading also contributes to personal growth, creativity, and lifelong learning, making it a fundamental skill for success in both personal and professional life.</p>
